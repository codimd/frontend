# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Deprecations
- This version of CodiMD is the last version that supports the following short-code syntaxes for embedding content. Embedding works now instead by putting the plain webpage link to the content into a single line.
    - `{%youtube someid %}` -> https://youtube.com/watch?v=someid
    - `{%vimeo 123456789 %}` -> https://vimeo.com/123456789
    - `{%gist user/12345 %}` -> https://gist.github.com/user/12345
    - `{%slideshare user/my-awesome-presentation %}` -> Embedding removed
    - `{%speakerdeck foobar %}` -> Embedding removed

### Removed

- SlideShare embedding
    - If a legacy embedding code is detected it will show the link to the presentation instead of the embedded presentation
- Speakerdeck embedding
    - If a legacy embedding code is detected it will show the link to the presentation instead of the embedded presentation
- Code highlighting for the follow languages

### Added

- A new table view for the history (besides the card view)

### Changed
